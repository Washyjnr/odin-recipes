        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, diced(about 3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat.</li>
            <li><p>In a large skillet heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil on medium high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides</p>
            Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</li>
            <li><p>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to a skillet.</p>
            <p>Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.</p>
            <p>Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low and cook for another five minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium sized (3 to 4 quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste in the pot</p>
            <p>Add the parsley, oregano and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt to taste.</p>
            <p>Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition, to taste.</p>
            <p>Add salt to taste and note that you will be adding Parmesan, which is salty.</p>
            <p>Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the bottom of the pot every so often so nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.</p>
            <P>Remove from heat.</P></li>
            <li><p>By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per package directions.</p>
            <p>Stir often to prevent sticking. Make sure that water remains at full boil during the entire cooking to prevent noodles from sticking.</p>
            <p>When ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently seperating any noodles that may be sticking together.</p>
            <p>Spread a little olive oil on a large baking sheet, and lay out the cooked noodles on this sheet, turning them over so that they get coated with a little of the olive oil.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Heat the oven at 375 degrees celcius</strong></li>
            <li><p>In a 9*13 inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and spread it over the bottom of the dish. Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise over the sauce. Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles</p>
                <p>Sprinkle a layer of a third of the grated mozarella on top of lasagna sauce. Add half of the ricota cheese, by placing cheese dollops every couple of inches. Sprinkle half the grated parmesan cheese evenly over the top of the ricotta cheese.</p>
                <p>Apply second layer of noodles, top it with half of the remaining sauce. Add half of the remaining Mozarella, the remaining ricotta cheese, and another the remaining Parmesan</p>
                <p>Finish with another layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle with the remaining Mozarella cheese.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Cover the lasagna pan with aluminium foil, tented slightly so it doesn't touch the noodles or sauce. Bake it at 375 degrees celcius for 45 minutes. Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or edges</li>
            <li>Allow the lasagna to cool at least 15 before serving. Leftovers will keep for 5 days. May be reheated in conventional oven or microwave. Leave aluminium tent on for storage. (Try to keep the aluminium foil from touching the sauce.)</li>
        </ol>
